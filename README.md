# AI Company Case Study - Module 1 Challenge

## Overview and Origin

[ThroughPut, Inc.](https://throughput.world/) will be featured in this case study.  And, as highlighted on Throughput's Web Page, the company is an "AI-powered supply chain intelligence and analytics platform that improves demand sensing, and capacity planning and unlocks supply chain profitability."  More specifically, as provided through their [linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/products/throughput/), ThroughPut’s AI-Powered Engine "provides an integrated view of company-wide operations to easily identify and manage constraints." Further in the profile, it is noted that the: 
>AI software suite taps into existing time-stamped data tied to your sales, purchasing, distribution, and manufacturing activities and puts operational improvements on autopilot. ThroughPut predicts demand, reorients production capacity, reassigns warehouse space, and reorders materials just-in-time, so you never miss out on customer demand again. On a single software, ThroughPut improves material flow and free cash flow, across your end-to-end value chain. 

A [5 minute presentation](https://info.throughput.world/throughput-demo-watch-on-demand?_gl=1*19tz669*_ga*NTY5NDIzODYuMTcxNTcxOTc5MA..*_ga_E6X5Q0DQ9K*MTcxNTc5MTAyNC40LjEuMTcxNTc5MTUxNS42MC4wLjA.), featured on Throughput's web site, and delivered by Founder and CEO Ali Raza, provides a clear demonstration of the solutions and related dashboards in support of the aforementioned company web profile statements. The demo highlights tools to optimize product-level demand to available capacity for planning, tools to drive strategies to prioritize growth in the most profitable products, tools to gain efficiency in shipping and logistics while mapping end-to-end supply channels, and tools to reduce bottlenecks/capacity constraints to optimize inventory.  Ultimately, the solutions are intended to provide data analysis and insights to strategically improve supply chain to maximize profitability and free-up capital.  

Based on information gathered from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/throughput-inc), [Pitchbook](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/180953-11#faqs), and [Golden](https://golden.com/wiki/ThroughPut_Inc.-GE8GX8M), the following key information has been gathered regarding the inception of ThroughPut, Inc.
1. Throughput, Inc. was founded February 17, 2017.
2. The Founders of the company are Ali Hasan Raza, Bhaskar Ballapragada, and Seth Page
3. The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA
4. Funding for the company has come from Venture Capital and Corporate investors through a series of seed rounds and angel rounds.  The total funding reported by Golden is in excess of $11M.  

As documented in a letter to the interested community from Founder and CEO, Ali Raza, posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-rigbasket-llc-rebranding-throughput-inc-ali-hasan-raza/) March 13, 2017, ThroughPut,Inc. was formed as a Rebranding of RigBasket LLC.  According to Mr. Raza, the change was driven by "the thought process from transforming from an oil&gas company that focuses on parts management, to a supply chain analytics company that has professional experience working in the oil&gas vertical." As such, Mr. Raza sites that "Since our rebranding to “ThroughPut”, we have been able to work across an array of industries, and outside of Houston."  In closing his letter, Mr. Raza provided the following...
>**Predictable Parts Ordering Is Cute, But Companies Really Want More ThroughPut**\
At the end of the day, there are tons of tracking technologies, pretty end-to-end software, and new devices that can improve supply chain today. Predictive analytics can dynamically change your forecasts, collaboration tools can expedite processing times, and a tracker might provide more safety to an operation. But what is all this craze around IoT and automation really about? As an engineering-heavy team, we too got lost in the technology, only to realize that what most companies, and in fact all companies, should care about is how new technologies affect their bottom line. “How do we enable more financial throughput?” is the question that should precede “This is cool stuff, should we get it?”. Companies want higher earnings per share, and higher valuations. So why not give it to them?  Moving forward, we will operate entirely as ThroughPut, Inc. with RigBasket serving oil&gas only.  We hope to continue serving you with the same enthusiasm of the original RigBasket team and a bigger ambition at ThroughPut.
